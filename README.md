# Installation

I'm too lazy to add this to the necessary repository so you'll have to do the hardwork.

Therefore these are the instructions. Download the theme somewhere and put it in the relevant path depending on your OS. More details are here:
https://ghostty.org/docs/features/theme#file-location

For MacOS, at least, you can do:
```sh
mkdir ~/.config/ghostty/themes # if this already exists ignore
ln -s /path/to/ghostty-ruska-theme/Ruska ~/.config/ghostty/themes/Ruska
```
